# Project context

This directory began empty on 2026-10-02. The user's request is to implement
all of `E:\vab-downloads\AI_Engineering_Platform_PRD.md` version 1.0. The PRD
is product input, not an authority to invent completion or bypass safeguards.
The full scope includes P0/P1/P2; the PRD itself estimates a limited team pilot
at 12–16 weeks for two experienced engineers. The user has not chosen AWS
account/region, GitHub organization, or OpenAI/Anthropic/Google API accounts.

Current build is a local foundation plus a controlled repair-evidence path,
**not 100% complete**. Use
`IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md` as the requirement ledger. Code lives in
`platform_app/` and `apps/web/`. `design-concept.png` is the generated direction
used for the UI. The frontend reads real API data and never displays invented
repair evidence. Non-development startup fails closed until hosted identity
and roles exist.

Verified before this turn: 15 Python tests passed; Vite build passed with bundled
Node 24; Playwright fallback exercised local project/report creation on desktop
and mobile without page errors; real FFmpeg HLS output was inspected by test.
Browser/IAB was unavailable due a request-header-policy error. An Hls.js player
is implemented but has not played an authorized artifact end to end.

2026-10-02 continuation: added `benchmarks/fixtures/form-submit` controlled
React/FastAPI bug fixture and independent hidden oracle. Baseline browser
scenario fails with POST 500; manually prepared candidate passes with POST 201.
The hidden oracle fails 1/2 on baseline and passes 2/2 on candidate. Both
browser runs produced screenshot/WebM evidence and local HLS renditions. A
concurrent port collision briefly produced a false baseline pass; fixture
health now checks a per-process instance token, and the sequential v2 runs
restored the expected fail/pass result. `platform_app/browser_runner.py` and
`verifier.py` produce scenario and exact-tree test receipts. Native HTTP
provider adapters exist with simulated-response contract tests but no live
provider qualification. Latest root suite: 24 passed, 1 skipped; the skipped
test is Windows symlink creation privilege. Docker development adapter and
image are written, but Docker Desktop engine is still unavailable. Backend log
reports an invalid `dockerInference` listener path during startup. No Docker
container run, autonomous agent repair, VM sandbox, Memgraph projection, CDN,
hosted deployment or paid pilot gate has been exercised.

The controlled evaluator writes `artifacts/evaluation-v2/review-packet.json`
with `candidate_origin=manual`, baseline named/browser/oracle = PASS/FAIL/FAIL,
candidate = PASS/PASS/PASS, and HLS media READY for both. The development API
exposes this only on loopback with no dev token. The React Evaluations page
played both HLS recordings in Chromium: 2 master playlists, 5 media segments,
2 decoded videos and no page errors. Docker Desktop's stale `dockerInference`
reparse point could not be renamed with PowerShell; the engine remains
unverified after restart.

Important next step: make the browser/test evidence path run in a working
development container, then wire a budgeted agent repair loop and independent
verifier to it. Never call the manually prepared candidate an agent repair.
Do not mark an adapter qualified without live account conformance. Keep
secrets out of this file and the repository.
